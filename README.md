Dev Community is Full-stack Blogging Application build with MERN. This project is inspired from dev.to website, I enjoyed and learned a lot while building this. I used React for Front-end User interface, Redux for State Management, Redux thunk for Asynchronous tasks, Express for Backend server, MongoDB Atlas for Database, JSON Web Tokens for Authentications, SHA256 Hashing Algo to hash password and Firbase for storage.
